Code samples for Meeting C++ Berlin 2025. Building them requires CMake, Google Benchmark and Google Test. Current setup assumes an AMD Zen4 CPU; feel free to adapt compiler paths and settings in `CMakeLists.txt`.

Slides can be found in the `presentation` subfolder, code snippets for the compiler explorer reside in the `godbolt` directory.
